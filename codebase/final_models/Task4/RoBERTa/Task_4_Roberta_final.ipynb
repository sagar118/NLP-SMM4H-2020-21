If you're coughing/sneezing, contain it. We get sick too. Remember what the Staple Singers said: Put your hand o'er your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution!

Other than a few signs at the airport in CR there was no effort being made to sanitize security bins, counters or terminals at all.
